## [0.1.0] – 2025-12-18

### Added

#### METAR parsing
- Full METAR string parsing with token-based architecture
- Support for:
    - Station identifier
    - Observation time (ddhhmmZ)
    - Wind (direction, speed, gusts, variable wind)
    - Visibility, including:
        - prevailing visibility
        - minimum visibility with direction (e.g. `2000SW`)
    - Cloud layers (FEW, SCT, BKN, OVC) with height and cloud type (CB, TCU)
    - Temperature and dew point
    - QNH / pressure
- Advanced weather phenomena parsing:
    - Intensity (`-`, `+`)
    - Descriptors (e.g. `TS`, `SH`, `FZ`, `VC`)
    - Phenomena (e.g. `RA`, `SN`, `BR`, `FG`)
    - Support for multiple simultaneous weather groups

#### TAF parsing
- Full TAF header parsing (station, issue time, validity period)
- Forecast groups support:
    - Base forecast
    - FM (From)
    - BECMG
    - TEMPO
    - PROB30 / PROB40 (with or without TEMPO)
- Reuse of METAR parsing logic for wind, visibility, clouds, and weather
- Structured forecast model with explicit period handling

#### Core architecture
- Clean separation between:
    - parsing logic
    - domain models
    - shared utilities
- Strongly typed models for METAR, TAF, forecasts, weather, clouds, and visibility
- Designed as a reusable parsing library (`metar-taf-core`)

#### CLI
- Initial command-line interface (`metar-taf-cli`)
- Parse and inspect METAR / TAF strings from standard input

#### Testing & quality
- Golden tests based on real-world METAR and TAF examples
- Unit tests for individual parsing components
- `cargo clippy` clean with `-D warnings`
